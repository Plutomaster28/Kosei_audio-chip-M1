Gotta work on these:

PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (Scaffolding Ready)
Digital Front-End

CD Support: EFM/CIRC stub exists, needs real decoder implementation
SPDIF/USB: Stub receivers exist, need actual protocol decoders
Clock & Jitter Management

High-Precision PLL: Clock manager stub exists, needs real PLL design
Jitter Attenuation: Measurement/correction framework stubbed
DAC Core

Hybrid R-2R: Multi-bit mode hook exists, needs actual R-2R implementation
Advanced Calibration: Basic trim implemented, needs full linearity cal

NOT IMPLEMENTED (Out of RTL Scope)
Analog Output Stage

Class-A differential buffers, op-amps, reconstruction filters
Multiple output modes (line/balanced/headphone)
Analog volume/preamp stage
Power & Noise Isolation

Separate analog/digital rails, LDOs
Star grounding, guard rings, substrate isolation
